== Summary

Welcome to the sapnwrfc PHP package.  This package is intended to facilitate RFC calls to an SAP R/3 system of release NW2004x and above.  It may work for earlier versions but it hasn't been tested.
The fundamental purpose of the production of this package, is to provide a clean object oriented interface to RFC calls from within PHP.  This will hopefully have a number of effects:
(1) make it really easy to do RFC calls to SAP from PHP in an object oriented fashion (Doh!)
(2) promote PHP as the interface/scripting/glue language of choice for interaction with SAP R/3.
(3) make the combination of Linux, Apache, and PHP the killer app for internet connectivity with SAP.
(4) Establish a small fun open source project that people are more than welcome to contribute to, if they so wish.
